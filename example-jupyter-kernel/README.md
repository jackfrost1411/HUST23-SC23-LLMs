Example Jupyter Kernel
======================

Post installation of a `genai` environment, Jupyter will not know about
the environment until an appropriate kernel interface is created. An
example of the typical interface structure is provided here. Note that
only two lines require updating: the python path to any new environment
and the appropriate display name.

Also see the `mkjupy` script provided by [an external github
repo][mkjupy].
